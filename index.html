	<p>Hi. My name is Alex Kim and I am an aspiring UX/Product designer. I believe that design is my calling; not because I am particularly good at design but because I believe design is ultimately about making good choices and that is an aspiration worth pursuing.</p>

	<p> Although my main interest is in design, I also enjoy working with the production side of a team and getting to know the challenges they face. I am comfortable with the main front-end development tools. I also enjoy designing and creating graphic art.
